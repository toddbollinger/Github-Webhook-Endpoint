# Github-Webhook-Endpoint

Github-Webhook-Endpoint is a .NET Core 2.2 Web API project which takes a Github Webhook push request and emails out basic details of the push.

Github already has push email notifications, but they tend to be too detailed for use as text messages to mobile phones.

Ideally you would use this endpoint to send email to your cell phone provider's email to text gateway to implement text messages.
